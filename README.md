#  Book Finder
Book Finder is a small web app I built for a take-home challenge.
The goal was to help **Alex** (a college student persona) quickly search and explore books using the [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api).

---

##  What this app does

-  Search for books by title (powered by Open Library)
-  Show a **Book of the Week** with cover and description
-  Browse books by categories
-  Simple profile page
-  About & Contact pages

Basically, itâ€™s like a mini personal book explorer for Alex.

##  What I used  

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (fast dev setup)  
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) (page navigation)  
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (styling)  
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) (icons)  
- [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) (book data)
